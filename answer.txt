Question 01:After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Answer: Because the function would create another copied of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD, so that when we swap the value
of these two new reference, the title of these two objects still remain.
->This also explains why Java is pass-by-value.

Question 02:After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Answer: Because the function create a copied of jungleDVD, let call jungleDVD_new. This reference point to the same object
as jungleDVD. So when we use the setTitle method for jungleDVD_new, the title of the object has changed, so that the title
of the JungleDVD changed. This will also happened simlilarly to the cinderellaDVD if we convert these two objects.
